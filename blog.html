          Storage and local Storage scope in JavaScript
        </h2>
        <p class="font-semibold text-[20px]">
          in JavaScript local storage and session storage are almost same kind
          of thing but there are some difference! before we discuss about the
          difference let's say what are them! <br />
          local storage and session storage
          <span class="text-fuchsia-500"
            >both are used for store some data on the browser or client side for
            later usecase, since both are used to store data on the browser but
            they had some fundamental difference.</span
          >
          let see what are the difference. <br />
          the data stored in the session storage are cleared whenever the user
          close that particular tab or window of the browser!
        </p>
        <img
          class="mx-auto rounded-lg shadow-lg my-4"

          alt=""
        />
        <p class="font-semibold text-[20px] mb-10">
          on the other hand the data were stored in the local storage they are
          never expire! another fundamental difference between then is the
          capacity of the bandwidth. in local storage we can store up to 10 MB
          of dada and in session storage we can store only 5 MB of data.
          <span class="text-fuchsia-500"
            >we can access local storage data from any window but we cannot
            access the session storage data without the current tab</span

          scope and local scope in JavaScript
        </h2>
        <p class="font-semibold text-[20px]">
          before we discuss about the difference between global and local scope
          in JavaScript we should discuss about the what is scope in JavaScript,
          in JavaScript the scope also known as lexical scope are nothing but
          just barricade of accessing the JavaScript variable we declared.<br />
          it was just and top level overview. to see more details about scope we
          can demonstrate using a code block!
        </p>
        <img
          class="mx-auto rounded-lg shadow-lg my-4"
          src="./images/scope.png"
          alt=""
        />
        <p class="font-semibold text-[20px]">
          global scope are basically the area of our JavaScript file outside of
          any given block!
          <span class="text-fuchsia-500"
            ><span class="text-fuchsia-500"
              >that means if we declare any variable in the Global scope we can
              access them from anywhere in that particular JavaScript
              file!</span
            ></span
          >
          on the other hand block scope or local scope are nothing but just a
          pair of {}, if we declare any variable using es6 to latest keyword let
          and const inside a block a local scope we cannot access them from
          outside of that block!

        </h2>
        <p class="font-semibold text-[20px]">
          in JavaScript we can get undefined in multiple ways! here is the list
          of some of the most common use case for getting undefined value <br />
          when you try to access a value of the variable that, the variable has
          been declared but the value has not with assigned
          <span class="text-fuchsia-500"
            >(if we did not declare the variable we will get reference error but
            if you declare the variable at do not assign null value then we will
            get undefined)

          alt=""
        />
        <p class="font-semibold text-[20px]">
          when we try to access a property of an object that never exist or try
          to access an element of an array that never exist! In JavaScript, we
          can explicitly set a variable value to undefined too!
          <span class="text-fuchsia-500"
            >remember undefined is a data type and a valid value in JavaScript
          </span>

        <p class="font-semibold text-[20px]">
          we all know that JavaScript is a single threaded programming language.
          then how does JavaScript handle its asynchronous programming?
          <span class="text-fuchsia-500"
            >JavaScript and do it because of event loop! event loop is nothing
            but a mechanism to stublished communication of call stack and the
            even que.</span
          >
          every asynchronous code we write, JavaScript give it to web Api's.
          When JS engine complete it synchronous code execution, the event que
          send and code block to the callstack of JS engine. This process will
          repeted until the event que is empty!
