          Difference Between Session Storage and local Storage scope in
          JavaScript
        </h2>
        <p class="font-semibold text-[20px]">
          in JavaScript local storage and session storage are almost same kind
          of thing but there are some difference! before we discuss about the
          difference let's say what are them! <br />
          local storage and session storage both are used for store some data on
          the browser or client side for later usecase, since both are used to
          store data on the browser but they had some fundamental difference.
          let see what are the difference. <br />
          the data stored in the session storage are cleared whenever the user
          close that particular tab or window of the browser!
        </p>
        <img
          class="mx-auto rounded-lg shadow-lg my-4"
          src="./images/storage.png"
          alt=""
        />
        <p class="font-semibold text-[20px] mb-10">
          on the other hand the data were stored in the local storage they are
          never expire! another fundamental difference between then is the
          capacity of the bandwidth. in local storage we can store up to 10 MB
          of dada and in session storage we can store only 5 MB of data we can
          access local storage data from any window but we cannot access the
          session storage data without the current tab

          Difference Between Global scope and local scope in JavaScript
        </h2>
        <p class="font-semibold text-[20px]">
          before we discuss about the difference between global and local scope
          in JavaScript we should discuss about the what is scope in JavaScript,
          in JavaScript the scope also known as lexical scope are nothing but
          just barricade of accessing the JavaScript variable we declared.<br />
          it was just and top level overview. to see more details about scope we
          can demonstrate using a code block!
        </p>
        <img
          class="mx-auto rounded-lg shadow-lg my-4"
          src="./images/scope.png"
          alt=""
        />
        <p class="font-semibold text-[20px]">
          global scope are basically the area of our JavaScript file outside of
          any given block! that means if we declare any variable in the Global
          scope we can access them from anywhere in that particular JavaScript
          file! on the other hand block scope or local scope are nothing but
          just a pair of {}, if we declare any variable using es6 to latest
          keyword let and const inside a block a local scope we cannot access
          them from outside of that block!

          Tell me some ways of getting undifined value
        </h2>
        <p class="font-semibold text-[20px]">
          in JavaScript we can get undefined in multiple ways! here is the list
          of some of the most common use case for getting undefined value <br />
          when you try to access a value of the variable that, the variable has
          been declared but the value has not with assigned
          <span class="text-fuchsia-500"
            >(if we did not declare the variable we will get reference error but
            if you declare the variable at do not assign null value then we will
            get undefined)
          </span>
        </p>
        <img
          class="mx-auto rounded-lg shadow-lg my-4"
          src="./images/undefined.png"
          alt=""
        />
        <p class="font-semibold text-[20px]">
          when we try to access a property of an object that never exist are try
          to access an element of an array that never exist! In JavaScript, we
          can explicitly set a variable value to undefined too!
          <span class="text-fuchsia-500"
            >remember undefined is a data type and a valid value in JavaScript
          </span>
          also there are some other ways to get undefined in javascript!
